# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a minimal project structure with only an image asset. The current state suggests this is either:
- A newly initialized project
- An asset repository for invitation/virtual projection materials
- A project in very early stages

## Current Structure

- `img/` - Contains image assets
  - `0513_ON AV EXPANDED_WHT.png` - Primary image asset (appears to be a logo or branding element)

## Development Notes

This repository currently contains only static assets and no build configuration, source code, or package management files. When adding development capabilities:

1. The repository is not currently a git repository
2. No package.json, Makefile, or other build configurations exist
3. No testing frameworks or linting tools are configured
4. No documentation files (README.md) are present

## Future Development Considerations

When expanding this repository, consider:
- Adding appropriate build tools based on the technology stack chosen
- Implementing version control with git
- Adding proper documentation structure
- Setting up development workflows and CI/CD if needed
